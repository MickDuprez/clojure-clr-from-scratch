# clojure-clr-from-scratch
This is going to be a series on how to use Clojure on the CLR, Iâ€™m no expert in either but what I learn along the way will be recorded here and hopefully may one day be useful to someone else.

This repo's structure is set out so that each folder contains an article/part or the series, each one building on the next.

The stories will be published in each folder's README file and also at Medium - https://medium.com/@mickduprez and are titled "Clojure CLR From Scratch" starting at Part 0.
